# Chapter 2: Literature Review

In this chapter, we will review the existing literature on occlusion handling in augmented reality (AR), and identify the research gap and the motivation for our study. We will organize the chapter into the following sections:

- Section 2.1: Introduction. We will provide an overview of the chapter and its objectives.
- Section 2.2: Occlusion Detection. [We will survey the different methods and techniques for determining the depth order and the occlusion regions between the virtual objects (VOs) and the real objects in AR, such as contour-based, depth-based, and 3D reconstruction-based methods](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/)[1](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/)[2](https://publication.aercafricalibrary.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/1821/CHAPTER_2_Topic%20Selection.pdf)[3](https://bookdown.org/robert_statmind/rm_01/intro.html).
- Section 2.3: Occlusion Rendering. [We will review the various approaches and algorithms for visualizing the occluded parts of the VOs and the real objects in AR, such as alpha blending, hole filling, inpainting, and image-based rendering](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/)[4](https://www.physicsandmathstutor.com/biology-revision/a-level-ocr-a/module-2/) .
- Section 2.4: Occlusion Display. [We will examine the different types of AR displays and their impact on occlusion handling, such as optical see-through, video see-through, and projection-based displays](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/)[1](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/) .
- Section 2.5: Occlusion Evaluation. [We will discuss the methods and metrics for evaluating the performance and the quality of occlusion handling in AR, such as accuracy, realism, consistency, and user satisfaction](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/)[1](https://mzwriters.com/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/how-to-write-chapter-two-of-research-projects/) .
- Section 2.6: Research Gap and Motivation. We will summarize the main findings and limitations of the existing literature, and highlight the research gap and the motivation for our study.
- Section 2.7: Conclusion. We will conclude the chapter and provide a transition to the next chapter.
